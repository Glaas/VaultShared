You're the apprentice, or a child that a wizard has rescued

the game starts with some cutscene, then the wizard explaining what he expects from you
you can cultivate crops in the basement of his tower
you could maybe unlock floors?

Start with one seed type and 4 plots, then harvest, then give some and sell some, and you can buy more things at a shop operated by another NPC
